# Kotlin CV PDF Generator
This is a little _(work in progress)_ application that creates a tidy PDF version of a CV that can be sent to employers or recruiters. The intention of this is to incorporate it into my personal website.

**Disclaimer!** _Right now this is sort of a mess and very annoying to use, but at least it gets the dirty job done and is a good starting point._

## Intentions With This Repository
I will probably keep this open source, and add on to it, even after I incorporate it into my personal website. Perhaps just make it a microservice for my web application. I also strongly believe in contributing to open source, and know how annoying it can be to programmatically generate a PDF - I also know how useful it can be, so this would be a very good example on one way to do it.

## Generate Your Own CV
Right now you use it simply by updating [Config.kt](/src/main/kotlin/io/nozemi/cvgenerator/Config.kt) with the information you want to present.
